# Codveda Python Internship – Python Development Tasks

This repository contains the tasks I completed during my **Python Development Internship** at **Codveda Technology**.  
It demonstrates my learning and skills in **basic, intermediate, and advanced Python programming**.

## **Level 1 – Basic Tasks**

### 1. Number Guessing Game (`guessing_game.py`)
- Generates a random number between 1 and 100
- User has limited attempts to guess the number
- Program gives feedback if the guess is too high or too low
- Concepts: random numbers, loops, conditionals, user input
### 2. Simple Calculator ('simple_calculator.py')
-Performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
-Handles division by zero with appropriate error messages.
-Concepts: functions, conditionals, user input.

## **Level 2 – Intermediate Tasks**

### 1. To-Do List Application (`todo_list.py`)
- Command-line application to manage tasks
- Features: Add task, View tasks, Mark as done, Delete task
- Tasks are stored in a JSON file for persistence
- Concepts: file handling, JSON, loops, conditional statements, user interaction
### 2. Weather Information Application ('api_integration.py')
-Fetches real-time weather data for any city using wttr.in API
-Displays temperature (°C / °F), weather condition, and humidity
-Implements error handling for failed requests and invalid responses
-Menu-driven interface for repeated queries
-Free API; no signup required

Concepts: API integration, JSON parsing, exception handling, user input
## **How to Run**
1. Download or clone the repository
2. Open the folder of the level you want
3. Run the Python file using:
   ```bash
   python filename.py
Technologies Used
-Python 3
-JSON (for To-Do List)
-Random module (for guessing game)
-Basic file handling and string manipulation
