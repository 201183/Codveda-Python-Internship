# Codveda Python Internship – Python Development Tasks

This repository contains the tasks I completed during my **Python Development Internship** at **Codveda Technology**.  
It demonstrates my learning and skills in **basic, intermediate, and advanced Python programming**.

## **Level 1 – Basic Tasks**

### 1. Number Guessing Game (`guessing_game.py`)
- Generates a random number between 1 and 100
- User has limited attempts to guess the number
- Program gives feedback if the guess is too high or too low
- Concepts: random numbers, loops, conditionals, user input

## **Level 2 – Intermediate Tasks**

### 2. To-Do List Application (`todo_list.py`)
- Command-line application to manage tasks
- Features: Add task, View tasks, Mark as done, Delete task
- Tasks are stored in a JSON file for persistence
- Concepts: file handling, JSON, loops, conditional statements, user interaction

## **Level 3 – Advanced Tasks**

### 3. File Encryption/Decryption (`encryption.py`)
- Encrypts or decrypts a text file using a simple numeric key
- Creates `encrypted_file.txt` or `decrypted_file.txt` as output
- Concepts: file handling, string manipulation, exception handling, simple encryption algorithm

## **How to Run**
1. Download or clone the repository
2. Open the folder of the level you want
3. Run the Python file using:
   ```bash
   python filename.py
